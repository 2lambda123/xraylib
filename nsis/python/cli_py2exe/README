The fully contained executable was built using py2exe, using the setup.py file found in this folder.

Running it as:
	
	python setup.py py2exe

produces the dist folder containing xraylib.exe as well as the Documentation and the Microsoft Visual Studio run time dll, which is necessary for the python interpreter.
